Easy Peasy Robotics Online Crash Course WEB20
=============================================

### Course at glance
Humanoid robots are complex machines, equipped with devices for visual, touch, auditory and force sensing, and embodied with sophisticated algorithms that enable to interact with the surrounding world. Building and programming such robots require expertise in different topics encompassing CAD design, control theory, computer vision, machine learning and software engineering.

We at the [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://iit.it) (IIT) know quite well what [building humanoids](https://icub.iit.it) means in terms of the effort and the struggle we have to devote to getting a beautiful mechanical body that finally does what we have studied hard to realize. But we also know how exciting and intriguing the science and the technology behind robotics can be and we have been always thrilled to share this awesome learning experience with novices. This is why we continue to organize supporting initiatives like our [summer/winter schools](https://icub.iit.it/projects/courses) and the **Easy Peasy Robotics Crash Course**.

In detail, the aim of the **4-days online crash course** is to provide participants with a brief overview of the research problems and applications related to humanoid robot programming, from perception to control. Also, we will cover aspects of mechanical design in simple scenarios to highlight the tight connection among all the steps of the design chain from ground up and thus to call attention to the importance of developing a multidisciplinary approach to robotics.

Unlike the [past editions](../README.md) of Easy Peasy Robotics that we held in presence, the **WEB20 event will be fully online** and will take place in **üìÖ October 2020, from Monday 26/10 to Thursday 29/10**. Read up the [course program](./course-program.md) to find out more.

Thereby, the course comprises a set of **lectures followed by hands-on sessions**, where we will make use of advanced online tools to walk you through the basics of how to design printable objects, and how to conceive and put to test in a simulated environment the control of the [iCub](https://icub.iit.it/products/icub-robot) humanoid. These tools will be running in the cloud and accessible in the browser, hence no installation is needed on your own PC.

Importantly, the fourth day of the course we will make the leap _sim-to-real_ to challenge what you have learned in simulation and see how well your code will perform when controlling a real iCub head ü§ñ

We will make sure that your software can be deployed seamlessly on our system at IIT and you will be watching your demo playing live on the iCub! ‚ú®

In addition to this fancy tech stuff and to avoid burning out your brains with a continuous flow of bits üòÑ, we will give you intermediate sessions to explore together methods for improving soft skills, to better engage in teams and foster collaboration among peers, which are all key in software development and more in general for your professional career. You will certainly enjoy these inspiring "pills" too!  

Here's a table summarizing the main information:

| üìÖ When? | **From 26 to 29 October 2020**|
| üíª Where? | **Online** | 

At the end of the crash course, you will be able to learn and exercise the foundamental principles of:
- **Software architectures for robot programming**
- **Robot control**
- **Robot vision**
- **CAD design of printable objects**
- **Cloud IDE's**
- **Open-source development**
- **Team building and collaboration**

### Applications
If you are an undergrad, a maker or a young scholar who loves robotics and wants to know more, or you are simply curious of how a robot works under the hood, don't hesitate to join our crash course and apply by visiting the [üìù submission page](https://easy-peasy-robotics.github.io/submission_instructions).

Be aware of the following requirements:
- Participants are expected to be skilled with **Linux** and to have background in computer programming in **C/C++** and in code management with **Git/GitHub**.
- We will accept max **20 participants**, as bigger students' groups are not easily manageable remotely given that we need to guarantee a decent quality of interaction among mentors and participants.
- Unfortunately, we are forced to restrict the attendance to applicants living in one of the time zones included in the range **[CEST-2h, CEST+2h]**, essentialy Europe and Africa. This is a necessity induced by the online classroom.
