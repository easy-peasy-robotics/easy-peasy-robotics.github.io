Course program at WEB20
=======================

The course is organized in **4 consecutive days** and will be **fully online**. Participants and mentors will thus join the online sessions that will take place in [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams).

The following timetables are expressed in [Central European Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time) (CET).

## Day 1Ô∏è‚É£

### Basics on YARP middleware
[YARP](http://www.yarp.it/index.html) is an **operating system for robotics** that has been designed to facilitate a number of activities we have to deal with while developing the software that controls our robots. In particular, YARP is very good at mastering **data transmission** in a distributed system, abstracting the **software API** from the hardware details, and building **complex architectures** that regulate the high-level robot behaviors as a collection of simpler blocks.

Through hands-on sessions, you will learn how to make code snippets run as threads that exchange pieces of information with another program or even the robot. Then, you will also see how to command a motor of the robot head in a very simple manner.

### Basics on CAD design
In this session, we are going to show you how to use an online tool for [**CAD design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design).
After an initial quick tour touching on the main functionalities and features, we will go deeper into the **3D printing oriented design**.
At the end, you will be able to model your own 3D object that in turn will be produced in our workshop just in time for being used in your demos (see [Day 4](#day-4%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3)).

## Day 2Ô∏è‚É£

### Basic PID Control
**Controlling the motors** in different modalities is a necessary part to let our robot undertake the correct **action** in response to the cues received from the world. Among all the huge number of control tools engineers have, the **PID controller** is undoubtedly one of the **simplest** and at the same time **most effective** solution. Further, the PID is so **ubiquitous** in our lives ‚Äî it can control nearly everything, up to a given extent üòè ‚Äî that knowing how it works will certainly turn out to be a **resource** you will be happy to own.   

In this lesson plus hands-on, you will learn how to control the robotic head with velocity commands to make the iCub gaze at different points in the space moving its articulated neck and eyes systems.

### Soft Skills
Wondering if you are a **risk taker**? Improve your soft skills with **"The jury" role-play** and find out more about your ability on **taking initiative and achieving goals**!

### Basic Computer Vision
Given you now know how to cope with the **action**, **perception** kicks in as the other side of the story. Therefore, to close the loop with the action, robots need to sense the world and gauge a large amount of information acquired from the surrounding.

In our settings, this means that you will learn how to analyze the content of the images the robot receives from the two cameras mounted in its eye bulbs. You will do so in terms of different **cues** (e.g. colors, depth, point-sets, shape, ...) and to perform some relevant **processing** (e.g. segmentation).

Additionally, we will explain **shape recognition** using traditional computer vision techniques based on models matching. Although Deep-Learning methods tend to be more popular nowadays, traditional approaches still power many applications. Many of these algorithms are also available in computer vision libraries like [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org), [**PCL**](https://pointclouds.org), [**CGAL**](https://www.cgal.org) and work very well out of the box.

## Day 3Ô∏è‚É£
Day 3 is mostly free to let you elaborate on what you have learned thus far. Also, we will give you time to prepare the code for the demo on the last day!
Of course, mentors will be always around to help. 

### Soft Skills
Have you ever wondered if you are a **problem solver**? Enhance your soft skills with **"TV guide" role-play** and start the journey within yourself to discover your **analytical and creativity ability**!
