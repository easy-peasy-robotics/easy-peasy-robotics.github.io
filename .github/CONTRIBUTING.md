#### General rules for posting

- Issue tracking systems can be seen as **advantageous alternatives to mailing lists** (read this [**post**](https://github.com/robotology/QA/issues/118)).
- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- Mentors are required to apply **labels** to questions for sorting purposes.
- Post here your **question** and mark it with **suitable label(s)**. We have a number of flavors available: general purpose labels, e.g. _help wanted_, _discussion_, _announcement_... so as lessons oriented labels e.g. _yarp_, _control_, _vision_. Don't forget to **mention a mentor** :wave: to trigger faster responses.
- We try to be neat and thus we _aim_ to **close questions** that have found their answers :smirk:.

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com), including instructions to run them.
