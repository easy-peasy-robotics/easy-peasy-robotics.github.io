## Easy Peasy Robotics Crash Course :robot:

### Course at glance
Humanoid robots are complex machines, equipped with devices for visual, touch, auditory and force sensing. Programming such robots require expertise in different disciplines encompassing control theory, computer vision, machine learning and software engineering.

The aim of this **2-days crash course** is to provide participants with a brief overview of the research problems and applications related to humanoid robot programming, from perception to control. The course is organized as a set of **lectures followed by hands-on sessions** using the **simulator** as well as a **real [iCub](http://www.icub.org) head**.

This crash course is a revised excerpt of the [_Veni Vidi Vici International Winter School on Humanoid Robot Programming_](http://icub.org/winterschool) and will cover the following topics:
- **Software architectures for robot programming (i.e. YARP)**
- **Robot control**
- **Robot vision**

Participants are expected to be skilled with **Linux** and to have background in computer programming in **C/C++** and in source code management with **Git/GitHub**. They should also **bring their own laptop** to attend hands-on sessions.
